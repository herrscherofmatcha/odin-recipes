        <p><em>Delicious </em> pizza dough recipe for your <strong>every</strong> pizza need~</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 cups All Purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp Active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups Cold water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Extra-virgin Olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven as high as it will go for at least 45 minutes to one hour.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of your kitchen aid and using the paddle attachment mix the flour, sea salt and active dry yeast (<--amazon) on low speed until all is incorporated then add the COLD water.</li>
            <li>Switch to the dough hook and mix together on low speed for 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should be smooth and sticky but should not stick to the sides of the bowl, only a little to the bottom.</li>
            <li>(If the dough sticks to the sides sprinkle in a little more flour, if it is too dry then add a bit more water).</li>
            <li>After the 8 minutes have passed remove the dough from the kitchen aid and cut it into 6 pieces and form them into rounds. Place them on a lightly oiled cookie sheet and drizzle with 1 tbs of extra virgin olive oil. Cover with plastic wrap and allow to sit at room temperature and rise for 2 hours in a draft free area. ( I prefer the oven )</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the counter with a little bit of flour, take one piece of dough and press down on it with your fingers until you have 1/2" thick circle or oval. Using your fists and knuckles start stretching the dough until 12" in diameter making sure not to tear it ( this should be easy since it is a small pie).</li>
        </ol>
